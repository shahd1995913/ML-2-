# Image classification use Machine learning ðŸ’»
# [Blood Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-disease-classification-tah/overview) ðŸ”—

# Steps ðŸ’¯
## 1. First Must Preprocessing images --> Resize and improve the intensity of the images dataset
## 2. Split data to train and test
## 3. Make Data Agumntaion for train Data only 
## 4. Extract Feature from Images Use HOG and Flatten() , HOG better than Flatten()
## 5. Use Machine learning Models called RF and SVM, RF is faster than SVM 
## 6. Test Data --> Only preprocessing without Data Agumntaion techniques
## 7. provide Accuracy 
## 8. Save CSV file and submit.

## RF with HOG give the best Accuracy ðŸ˜ƒ
